/// Provides a factory for creating PostgreSQL database contexts for the ChainSharp.Effect.Data system.
/// This factory creates production-ready database contexts for scenarios where persistent storage is required.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="dbContextFactory">The Entity Framework Core DbContext factory to use for creating contexts</param>
/// <remarks>
/// The PostgresContextProviderFactory class is a key component in the ChainSharp.Effect.Data.Postgres system.
/// It implements the IDataContextProviderFactory interface to create PostgresContext instances
/// that use Entity Framework Core's PostgreSQL database provider.
/// 
/// This factory:
/// 1. Uses Entity Framework Core's DbContextFactory for efficient context creation
/// 2. Tracks the number of contexts created for monitoring purposes
/// 3. Provides both synchronous and asynchronous context creation methods
/// 
/// Unlike the in-memory implementation, this factory requires a properly configured DbContextFactory
/// that is typically set up with a connection string and other PostgreSQL-specific options.
/// 
/// The factory is registered with the dependency injection container using
/// the AddPostgresEffect extension method in ServiceExtensions.
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```csharp
/// services.AddChainSharpEffects(options => 
///     options.AddPostgresEffect("Host=localhost;Database=chainsharp;Username=postgres;Password=password")
/// );
/// ```
/// </remarks>
