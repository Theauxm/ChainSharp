/// The DatabaseMigrator class is responsible for ensuring that the PostgreSQL database schema
/// is up-to-date with the latest version of the ChainSharp.Effect.Data.Postgres system.
/// 
/// This class:
/// 1. Creates the necessary schema if it doesn't exist
/// 2. Applies embedded SQL migration scripts in order
/// 3. Tracks applied migrations in a migrations table
/// 
/// The migration process is handled by the DbUp library, which provides a robust
/// framework for database migrations with features like versioning, script ordering,
/// and transaction support.
/// 
/// This class is typically used when the application starts up to ensure that
/// the database schema is compatible with the current version of the application.
