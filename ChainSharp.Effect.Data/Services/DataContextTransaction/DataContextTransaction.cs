/// <param name="tx">The underlying Entity Framework Core transaction</param>
/// <remarks>
/// The DataContextTransaction class is a key component in the ChainSharp.Effect.Data transaction management system.
/// It implements the IDataContextTransaction interface and provides a bridge between the ChainSharp.Effect.Data
/// transaction abstraction and Entity Framework Core's transaction implementation.
///
/// This class:
/// 1. Implements IDataContextTransaction to provide a consistent transaction API
/// 2. Delegates transaction operations to the data context and underlying EF Core transaction
/// 3. Ensures proper resource cleanup through the IDisposable implementation
///
/// By wrapping the EF Core transaction, this class simplifies transaction management for consumers
/// and ensures that transactions are properly managed regardless of the specific database provider.
/// </remarks>
