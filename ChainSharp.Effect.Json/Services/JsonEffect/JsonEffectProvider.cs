/// The JsonEffectProvider class provides an implementation of the IJsonEffectProvider interface
/// that uses JSON serialization to track and record changes to models.
///
/// This provider maintains a dictionary of tracked models and their previous serialized states.
/// When changes are saved, it compares the current serialized state of each model with its
/// previous state, and logs any changes that are detected.
///
/// The provider uses the JSON serialization options configured in the ChainSharp effect
/// configuration to serialize models to JSON format.
///
/// This implementation is useful for debugging, auditing, and logging purposes, as it
/// provides a way to track and record all changes made to models during workflow execution.
