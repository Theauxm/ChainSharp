/// The workflow registry is a key component of the mediator pattern implementation for workflows.
/// It maintains a dictionary that maps input types to workflow types, allowing the workflow bus
/// to dynamically discover and execute the appropriate workflow for a given input type.
///
/// The registry is typically populated during application startup by scanning assemblies for
/// workflow implementations and extracting their input types. This enables a type-based dispatch
/// mechanism where workflows are automatically discovered and registered without requiring
/// explicit registration code.
///
/// The registry is used by the workflow bus to look up the appropriate workflow type for a
/// given input object, which is then instantiated and executed.
