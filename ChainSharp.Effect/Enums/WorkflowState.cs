/// The WorkflowState enum is used to track the current state of a workflow
/// in the metadata tracking system. It provides a standardized way to
/// represent the workflow's progress and outcome.

/// This enum is particularly important for:
/// 1. Filtering workflows by state in reporting and monitoring tools
/// 2. Determining which workflows need attention (e.g., failed workflows)
/// 3. Understanding the overall health of the workflow system
/// 4. Tracking the progress of long-running workflows
