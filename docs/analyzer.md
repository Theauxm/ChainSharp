# Analyzer

ChainSharp includes a Roslyn analyzer that validates your workflow chains at compile time. When you chain steps via `.Chain<TStep>()`, the analyzer simulates the runtime Memory dictionary to verify that each step's input type is available before that step executes.

## The Problem

Consider this workflow:

```csharp
Activate(input)                          // input: ExecuteManifestRequest
    .Chain<LoadMetadataStep>()           // TIn=ExecuteManifestRequest → TOut=Metadata
    .Chain<ValidateMetadataStateStep>()  // TIn=Metadata → TOut=Unit
    .Chain<ExecuteScheduledWorkflowStep>()
    .Chain<UpdateManifestSuccessStep>()
    .Resolve();
```

If someone removes `LoadMetadataStep`, `ValidateMetadataStateStep` expects `Metadata` in Memory but nothing produces it. Today this is a runtime error—the workflow fails when it tries to find `Metadata` in the dictionary. You won't discover this until the code actually runs.

The analyzer makes it a compile-time error. You see the problem immediately in your IDE, before you even build.

## What It Checks

The analyzer triggers on every `.Resolve()` call in a `Workflow<,>` or `EffectWorkflow<,>` subclass. It walks backward through the fluent chain to `Activate()`, then simulates Memory forward:

```
Activate(input)       → Memory = { TInput, Unit }
.Chain<StepA>()       → Check: is StepA's TIn in Memory? Add StepA's TOut.
.Chain<StepB>()       → Check: is StepB's TIn in Memory? Add StepB's TOut.
.Resolve()            → Check: is TReturn in Memory?
```

| Method | What the analyzer does |
|--------|----------------------|
| `Activate(input)` | Seeds Memory with `TInput` and `Unit` |
| `.Chain<TStep>()` | Checks `TIn ∈ Memory`, then adds `TOut` |
| `.ShortCircuit<TStep>()` | Same as `Chain` — checks `TIn ∈ Memory`, adds `TOut` |
| `.AddServices<T1, T2>()` | Adds each type argument to Memory |
| `.Extract<TIn, TOut>()` | Adds `TOut` to Memory |
| `.Resolve()` | Checks `TReturn ∈ Memory` |

## Diagnostics

### CHAIN001: Step input type not available (Error)

Fires when a step needs a type that no previous step has produced.

```csharp
public class BrokenWorkflow : EffectWorkflow<string, Unit>
{
    protected override async Task<Either<Exception, Unit>> RunInternal(string input) =>
        Activate(input)
            .Chain<LogGreetingStep>()  // ← CHAIN001: LogGreetingStep requires HelloWorldInput,
            .Resolve();               //   but Memory only has [string, Unit]
}
```

The message tells you exactly what's missing and what's available:

```
error CHAIN001: Step 'LogGreetingStep' requires input type 'HelloWorldInput'
which has not been produced by a previous step. Available: [string, Unit].
```

### CHAIN002: Workflow return type not available (Error)

Fires when `Resolve()` needs a type that hasn't been produced. The analyzer tracks all chain methods including `ShortCircuit`, so a missing return type is always an error.

```csharp
public class MissingReturnWorkflow : EffectWorkflow<OrderRequest, Receipt>
{
    protected override async Task<Either<Exception, Receipt>> RunInternal(OrderRequest input) =>
        Activate(input)
            .Chain<ValidateOrderStep>()  // Returns Unit
            .Resolve();                  // ← CHAIN002: Receipt not in Memory
}
```

## Tuple and Interface Handling

The analyzer mirrors the runtime's Memory behavior:

**Tuple outputs are decomposed.** When a step produces `(User, Order)`, the analyzer adds `User` and `Order` to Memory individually (not the tuple itself). This matches how the runtime stores tuple elements.

**Tuple inputs are validated component-by-component.** When a step takes `(User, Order)`, the analyzer checks that both `User` and `Order` are individually available in Memory.

**Interface resolution works through concrete types.** When a step produces `ConcreteUser` (which implements `IUser`), the analyzer adds both `ConcreteUser` and `IUser` to Memory. A subsequent step requiring `IUser` will pass validation.

## Known Limitations

**Sibling interface inputs.** When the workflow's `TInput` is an interface (e.g., `Workflow<IFoo, Unit>`) and a step requires a different interface that the runtime concrete type also implements, the analyzer can't verify this. Suppress with `#pragma warning disable CHAIN001`.

**Cross-method chains.** The analyzer only looks within a single method body. If you build a chain across helper methods, it won't follow the calls.

## Setup

The analyzer ships with the ChainSharp NuGet package. If you're referencing ChainSharp, you already have it—no additional setup required.

For development within the ChainSharp solution itself, the analyzer is propagated to all projects via `Directory.Build.props`:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(MSBuildProjectName)' != 'ChainSharp.Analyzers'">
    <ProjectReference Include="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)src/analyzers/ChainSharp.Analyzers/ChainSharp.Analyzers.csproj"
                      ReferenceOutputAssembly="false"
                      OutputItemType="Analyzer" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Suppressing Diagnostics

If the analyzer fires on a chain that you know is correct (interface patterns, dynamic Memory seeding, etc.), suppress it with a pragma:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable CHAIN001
    .Chain<MyDynamicStep>()
#pragma warning restore CHAIN001
```

Or suppress at the project level in your `.csproj`:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CHAIN001</NoWarn>
</PropertyGroup>
```
