# TaskServerExecutorWorkflow

The TaskServerExecutor is what actually runs your workflow. It executes on background task server workers (Hangfire, typically) and handles the bookkeeping around each execution: loading the metadata, validating state, invoking the workflow, and recording success.

## Chain

```
LoadMetadata → ValidateMetadataState → ExecuteScheduledWorkflow →
                                        UpdateManifestSuccess → SaveDatabaseChanges
```

## Input

```csharp
public record ExecuteManifestRequest(int MetadataId, object? Input);
```

The `MetadataId` points to the `Metadata` row created by the [JobDispatcher](job-dispatcher.md). The `Input` is the deserialized workflow input passed through from the work queue.

## Steps

### LoadMetadataStep

Loads the `Metadata` record by ID, eagerly including its `Manifest` navigation (needed later by `UpdateManifestSuccessStep`). If the input includes a non-null `Input` object, it wraps it in a `ResolvedWorkflowInput` for type-safe routing through ChainSharp's memory system.

### ValidateMetadataStateStep

Checks that the loaded metadata is in `WorkflowState.Pending`. If it's already `InProgress`, `Completed`, or `Failed`, the step throws. This guards against duplicate execution—if Hangfire retries a job that already started, this step catches it.

### ExecuteScheduledWorkflowStep

Resolves the target workflow via `IWorkflowBus` using the deserialized input and invokes it. This is where your workflow's `RunInternal` method gets called. The workflow runs as a nested workflow under the TaskServerExecutor's own metadata, maintaining the parent-child relationship in the metadata tree.

### UpdateManifestSuccessStep

If the workflow completed successfully and the metadata has an associated manifest, updates `Manifest.LastSuccessfulRun` to `DateTime.UtcNow`. This timestamp is what drives [dependent workflow](../dependent-workflows.md) evaluation—downstream manifests won't fire until this value advances past their own `LastSuccessfulRun`.

If there's no manifest (e.g., an ad-hoc execution), this step is a no-op.

### SaveDatabaseChangesStep

Persists all pending database changes—primarily the `LastSuccessfulRun` update. This is a separate step rather than being folded into `UpdateManifestSuccessStep` so that the save happens as its own observable step in the chain, with its own timing in step metadata.

## Concurrency Model: Upstream Guarantee + State Guard

The TaskServerExecutor does not use any database-level locking of its own. Its safety relies on two mechanisms:

### Upstream Single-Dispatch Guarantee

The [JobDispatcher](job-dispatcher.md) uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to atomically claim each WorkQueue entry before creating its Metadata record. This guarantees that for any given WorkQueue entry, exactly one Metadata record is created and exactly one background task is enqueued. The TaskServerExecutor inherits this guarantee — it is only invoked once per Metadata ID.

### State Validation Guard

`ValidateMetadataStateStep` acts as a defense-in-depth check. It throws a `WorkflowException` if the metadata is in any state other than `Pending`. This catches edge cases where the background task server might retry a job that has already started (e.g., Hangfire retrying after a visibility timeout). Once the `WorkflowBus` transitions the metadata to `InProgress`, any duplicate invocation will be rejected.

This is an **optimistic** guard — it reads the state without acquiring a lock. In the theoretical scenario where two workers execute the same Metadata ID simultaneously (which the JobDispatcher prevents), both could read `Pending` before either transitions to `InProgress`. This is acceptable because the upstream guarantee makes this scenario unreachable in practice.

### No Wrapping Transaction

The workflow does not wrap its steps in an explicit transaction. `LoadMetadataStep` loads the Metadata and its Manifest as **tracked EF Core entities** (not `AsNoTracking`), so `UpdateManifestSuccessStep` can mutate `Manifest.LastSuccessfulRun` in memory and `SaveDatabaseChangesStep` persists the change at the end. If the workflow fails before `SaveDatabaseChangesStep`, `LastSuccessfulRun` is not updated — which is the correct behavior, since a failed execution should not advance the dependent workflow chain.

See [Multi-Server Concurrency](../concurrency.md) for the full cross-service concurrency model.

## Assembly Registration

The `TaskServerExecutorWorkflow` lives in the `ChainSharp.Effect.Orchestration.Scheduler` assembly. The `WorkflowBus` discovers workflows by scanning assemblies, so this assembly must be registered:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddChainSharpEffects(options => options
    .AddEffectWorkflowBus(
        typeof(Program).Assembly,
        typeof(TaskServerExecutorWorkflow).Assembly  // required
    )
);
```

*API Reference: [AddEffectWorkflowBus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link api-reference/configuration/add-effect-workflow-bus.md %})*

If you forget this, scheduled jobs will silently fail—Hangfire will invoke the TaskServerExecutor, but the WorkflowBus won't find it. No error, just nothing happens.
