/// Defines the contract for a component that tracks and persists workflow metadata.

/// <remarks>
/// The IEffectProvider interface is a key abstraction in the ChainSharp.Effect system.
/// It represents a mechanism for tracking and persisting workflow metadata, such as
/// execution details, inputs, outputs, and error information.
///
/// Different implementations of this interface can store metadata in different ways,
/// such as in a database, in memory, or in a file. This allows for flexibility in
/// how workflow execution is tracked and monitored.
///
/// The provider pattern used here allows for:
/// 1. Separation of concerns between workflow execution and metadata tracking
/// 2. Multiple tracking mechanisms to be used simultaneously
/// 3. Easy extension with new tracking mechanisms
/// </remarks>

    /// properties directly, then calls Update to notify all providers of the change.
