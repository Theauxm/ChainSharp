/// <summary>
/// Implements the workflow bus that dynamically executes workflows based on their input type.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The WorkflowBus class provides the core implementation of the mediator pattern for workflows.
/// It uses reflection and dependency injection to dynamically discover, instantiate, and execute
/// the appropriate workflow for a given input type.
///
/// The workflow bus relies on the workflow registry to map input types to workflow types,
/// and uses the service provider to resolve and instantiate the workflow instances.
///
/// This implementation supports:
/// - Dynamic workflow discovery based on input type
/// - Automatic dependency injection for workflow instances
/// - Property injection for workflows
/// - Metadata association for tracking and logging
/// - Type-safe execution with generic output types
///
/// The workflow bus is typically registered as a scoped service in the dependency injection
/// container, allowing it to be injected into controllers, services, or other components
/// that need to execute workflows.
/// </remarks>
