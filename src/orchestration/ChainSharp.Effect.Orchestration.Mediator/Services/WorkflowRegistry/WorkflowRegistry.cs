/// <remarks>
/// The WorkflowRegistry class provides the core implementation of the workflow registry.
/// It scans the provided assemblies for workflow implementations and builds a dictionary
/// that maps input types to workflow types.
///
/// The registry uses reflection to discover workflow implementations in the provided assemblies.
/// It looks for classes that implement the IEffectWorkflow&lt;TIn, TOut&gt; interface and
/// extracts their input types to build the mapping.
///
/// This implementation supports:
/// - Automatic workflow discovery via assembly scanning
/// - Interface-based workflow registration (preferring interfaces over concrete types)
/// - Comprehensive error reporting for invalid workflow implementations
///
/// The registry is typically created during application startup and registered as a singleton
/// in the dependency injection container, allowing it to be injected into the workflow bus.
