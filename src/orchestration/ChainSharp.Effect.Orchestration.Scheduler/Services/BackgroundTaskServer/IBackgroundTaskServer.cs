/// Abstraction over background task servers (Hangfire, Quartz, etc.) for enqueuing and scheduling jobs.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface provides a provider-agnostic way to enqueue background tasks.
/// Implementations can wrap Hangfire, Quartz.NET, or any other background job processing library.
///
/// The abstraction allows ChainSharp.Effect.Orchestration.Scheduler to remain decoupled from specific
/// background task implementations, enabling consumers to use their preferred infrastructure.
///
/// Example implementations:
/// - HangfireTaskServer (in ChainSharp.Effect.Orchestration.Scheduler.Hangfire)
/// - QuartzTaskServer (in ChainSharp.Effect.Orchestration.Scheduler.Quartz)
///
/// Implementations should resolve <see cref="ITaskServerExecutorWorkflow"/> from the DI container
/// and call <see cref="ITaskServerExecutorWorkflow.Run"/> with an <see cref="ExecuteManifestRequest"/>.
/// </remarks>
